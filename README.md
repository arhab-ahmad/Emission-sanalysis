Analyze Methane gas Emission Globally

Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term global warming and improving air quality. The energy sector – including oil, natural gas, coal, and bioenergy – accounts for nearly 40% of methane emissions from human activity.

In this project, we will see the emission of methane gas globally and try to understand the reasons for emission or if we can prevent it.

The following dataset has information about methane gas emissions globally. Details about the columns are as follows:

region -

country - Country of Emission.

emissions - Methane Emissions in kt.

type - Sector from which emissions occur.

Segment- Sub-sector from which emissions occur.

reason - The reason for the emission.

base-Year - Base year for the tracking of emissions.

notes - The source of data
