Analyze Methane gas Emission

Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term global warming and improving air quality. The energy sector – including oil, natural gas, coal, and bioenergy – accounts for nearly 40% of methane emissions from human activity.

In this project, we will see the emission of methane gas globally and try to understand the reasons for emission or if we can prevent it.
